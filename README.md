#Teacher Tracker Program

###Written by Ellen Lehman

##Set UP
To set up this program, clone the repository from Github and open the program in your terminal by running $ruby teacher_tracker_ui.rb.

##What It Does
This program is for a teacher to track all of the students and assignments in their classes.  A teacher can create different periods, which will hold many students.  Each student can be assigned various assignments and the scores those students received on those assignments will be stored as well.

##Known Bugs
This program does not have the current capability of deleting or editing periods, students, or assignments after they have been created.  This program also does not use a database, and therefore all information will be lost once the program is exited.
